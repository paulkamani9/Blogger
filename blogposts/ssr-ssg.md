This essay critically discusses social media’s impact on society and cross-examines social media’s influence on the community, analysing both the positive and negative effects of social media use in society. “The diffusion of social media throughout society and its institutions has been rapid and diverse. (McCabe and Harris, 2021).” Although Li et al. (2020) underlined the significant role social media plays in contemporary activism, Abi-Jaoude et al. (2020) highlighted the consequences of social media use on the mental health of youths and adolescents. Shu et al. (2020) considered social media a crucial means of spreading fake news and misinformation. Farsi (2021) supported social media as a significant medium for improving the services of the healthcare sector. This essay inspects both sides of the debate and contends that social media use should be restricted due to its adverse effects on society.
