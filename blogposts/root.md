Social media causes mental health problems among youths, including depression, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts, inability to socialize and poor academic performance. Social media also serves as a key means for disseminating disinformation and propaganda by spiteful agents for political, personal, and financial gains, leading to the detriment of democracy in society. Social media is a powerful medium for novel activism and social movements; to address societal issues and demand lasting change.

The presence of mentally depleted youths is detrimental to society, and the proliferation of disinformation poses a severe threat to democracy within the societal framework.
